# catFactsReactApp
## This is a simple react app that I created based off of a python script I created a couple years ago. The app is faily simple, it takes a randomized image of a car from an API as well as a randomized fact about cats from another API and combines them. When the button is clicked it combines the two for a random image and fact.
