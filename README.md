# catFactsReactApp
### This is a simple React app that I created based on a Python script I created a couple of years ago. The app is fairly simple, it takes a randomized image of a car from an API as well as a randomized fact about cats from another API and combines them. When the button is clicked it combines the two for a random image and fact.
